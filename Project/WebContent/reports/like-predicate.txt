We use the LIKE predicate in 3 functions inside the Query.java file. 

In the first function, public ArrayList<Movie> browseByTitle(String character, String order, int offset, String sort, String limit), we're passed a character which determines what title the user wants to browse by. We use LIKE [character] to find the list of movies that start with the specified character.

In the second function, public ArrayList<Movie> quickSearch(String pattern, String order, int offset, String sort), we're passed a pattern by the user to determine what movie they want to search for. We use LIKE [%pattern%] in order to query all the movies that have the pattern in any part of its title.

In the third function, public ArrayList<Movie> advanceSearch(String title, String year, String director, String firstName, String lastName, String order, int offset, String sort), we're passed a number of optional advance search arguments. The function will take a combination of all of the arguments and query for any matching movie using LIKE. For example, if the user passes in title we will query LIKE [%title%] to find any movies with title in any part of its name. If the user also passes in year, we use LIKE [%title%] AND LIKE [%year%] to find any movie that satisfies both queries.
